# Dart Reduce Method and Empty Lists

This example demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list to function correctly; otherwise, it throws an `UnsupportedError`. 

The `bug.dart` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.dart` provides a solution to handle empty lists gracefully.
